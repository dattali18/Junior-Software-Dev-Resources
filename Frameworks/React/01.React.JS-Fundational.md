# JS Fundamentals

## Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is commonly used for web development. Understanding its fundamental concepts is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

## Variables
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data values. They can be declared using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

### Example
```javascript
// Variable declaration
var name = "John";
let age = 30;
const PI = 3.14;
```

the differences between the `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords in JavaScript:

1. `var`:
   - `var` was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript.
   - Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped or globally scoped, but not block-scoped. This means that a variable declared inside a function is only accessible within that function, and a variable declared outside any function is accessible globally.
   - Variables declared with `var` can be redeclared and reassigned.

   ```javascript
   var x = 10;
   var x = 20; // Allowed, redeclaration
   x = 30; // Allowed, reassigned
   ```

2. `let`:
   - `let` was introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) to address some of the issues with `var`.
   - Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped. This means that a variable declared inside a block (e.g., within an `if` statement or a `for` loop) is only accessible within that block.
   - Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned, but not redeclared in the same scope.

   ```javascript
   let y = 10;
   // let y = 20; // Not allowed, redeclaration
   y = 30; // Allowed, reassigned
   ```

3. `const`:
   - `const` also came with ES6 and is used to declare constants, whose value cannot be changed once defined.
   - Like `let`, variables declared with `const` are block-scoped.
   - Variables declared with `const` must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be left uninitialized.

   ```javascript
   const z = 10;
   // z = 20; // Not allowed, reassignment
   // const z = 30; // Not allowed, redeclaration
   ```

In summary, `var` is function-scoped, `let` is block-scoped and allows reassignment, while `const` is also block-scoped but does not allow reassignment. It's generally recommended to use `const` by default for variables that you don't intend to reassign, and use `let` only when you need to reassign a variable.
## Data Types
JavaScript supports several data types, including numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, and more.

### Example
```javascript
let num = 10; // number
let str = "Hello"; // string
let isTrue = true; // boolean
let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array
let obj = { key: "value" }; // object
```

JavaScript supports several data types, which can be broadly categorized into two categories: primitive and non-primitive (reference) types.

1. **Primitive Data Types**:
   - **Number**: Represents numeric values. It includes integers, floats, and special numeric values like `NaN` (Not a Number) and `Infinity`.
   - **String**: Represents sequences of characters, enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.
   - **Boolean**: Represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.
   - **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - **Null**: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - **Symbol** (ES6): Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.

2. **Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types**:
   - **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type, including other objects.
   - **Array**: Represents a list-like collection of elements, where elements can be of any data type, including other arrays or objects.
   - **Function**: Represents a reusable block of code that can be called with a set of arguments.
   - **Date**: Represents a date and time value.
   - **RegExp**: Represents a regular expression pattern, used for pattern matching within strings.
   - **Error**: Represents an error object that contains information about an error that occurred in the code.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This flexibility allows for more concise and expressive code, but it also requires careful handling of data types to avoid unexpected behavior.

1. **Number**:
   ```javascript
   let num = 10;
   let floatNum = 3.14;
   let specialNum = NaN;
   let infinityNum = Infinity;
   ```

2. **String**:
   ```javascript
   let str = "Hello, World!";
   ```

3. **Boolean**:
   ```javascript
   let isTrue = true;
   let isFalse = false;
   ```

4. **Undefined**:
   ```javascript
   let undefinedVar;
   ```

5. **Null**:
   ```javascript
   let nullVar = null;
   ```

6. **Symbol** (ES6):
   ```javascript
   let sym = Symbol("unique");
   ```

7. **Object**:
   ```javascript
   let obj = { key: "value" };
   ```

8. **Array**:
   ```javascript
   let arr = [1, 2, 3];
   ```

9. **Function**:
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   }
   ```

10. **Date**:
    ```javascript
    let date = new Date();
    ```

11. **RegExp**:
    ```javascript
    let pattern = /hello/;
    ```

12. **Error**:
    ```javascript
    let error = new Error("Something went wrong");
    ```

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of each data type in JavaScript.
## Functions
Functions in JavaScript are reusable blocks of code that can be called with a set of arguments.

### Example
```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}
console.log(greet("John")); // Output: Hello, John!
```

In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be treated like any other variable. There are several types of functions in JavaScript, including:

1. **Function Declaration**:
   ```javascript
   function greet(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   }
   ```

2. **Function Expression**:
   ```javascript
   const greet = function(name) {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   };
   ```

3. **Arrow Function** (ES6):
   ```javascript
   const greet = (name) => {
       return "Hello, " + name + "!";
   };
   ```

4. **Method**:
   ```javascript
   const person = {
       name: "John",
       greet: function() {
           return "Hello, " + this.name + "!";
       }
   };
   ```

5. **Constructor Function**:
   ```javascript
   function Person(name) {
       this.name = name;
   }
   const john = new Person("John");
   ```
## Control Flow
JavaScript uses `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch` statements for controlling the flow of execution.

### Example
```javascript
let num = 5;
if (num > 0) {
    console.log("Positive");
} else if (num < 0) {
    console.log("Negative");
} else {
    console.log("Zero");
}
```

## `this` Keyword

The `this` keyword in JavaScript is a special keyword that refers to the object that is currently executing the function. Its value depends on how a function is called:

- In a regular function, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in a browser, `global` in Node.js) in non-strict mode, and `undefined` in strict mode.
- In a method (a function that is a property of an object), `this` refers to the object that the method is called on.
- In an arrow function, `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context. It does not have its own `this` value and is not affected by how or where it is called.

It's important to understand the different types of functions in JavaScript and how the `this` keyword behaves, as it can lead to unexpected behavior if not used correctly.
## Comment
Understanding these fundamental concepts will provide a solid foundation for further learning and development in JavaScript.

## ES6
ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, brought several new features and improvements to JavaScript. Some of the key features introduced in ES6 include:

1. **let and const**: `let` and `const` were introduced as new variable declaration keywords. `let` is block-scoped, and `const` is used to declare constants.

2. **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions, especially for one-liners. They also inherit the `this` value from the surrounding code.

3. **Template Literals**: Template literals allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings, using backticks (`).

4. **Destructuring Assignment**: Destructuring allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into distinct variables, making code more readable and concise.

5. **Spread Syntax**: The spread syntax (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected.

6. **Rest Parameters**: The rest parameter syntax (`...`) allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

7. **Default Parameters**: Default parameter values can now be specified for functions, so that parameters take on a default value if not explicitly provided.

8. **Classes**: ES6 introduced a new syntax for defining classes in JavaScript, providing a more familiar and cleaner syntax for object-oriented programming.

9. **Modules**: ES6 introduced a standardized module format for JavaScript, using `import` and `export` statements, allowing for better code organization and reuse.

10. **Promises**: Promises provide a cleaner way to work with asynchronous code, replacing callback-based approaches.

11. **Symbol**: The `Symbol` data type was introduced, providing a way to create unique identifiers.

12. **Iterators and Generators**: ES6 introduced the concept of iterators and generators, which provide a more flexible way to iterate over data structures.

These are just some of the key features introduced in ES6. ES6 significantly improved the readability, maintainability, and functionality of JavaScript code, making it a more powerful and expressive language.

### Example

1. **let and const**:
   ```javascript
   let x = 10;
   const PI = 3.14;
   ```

2. **Arrow Functions**:
   ```javascript
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   ```

3. **Template Literals**:
   ```javascript
   const name = "John";
   console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
   ```

4. **Destructuring Assignment**:
   ```javascript
   const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
   const { name, age } = person;
   ```

5. **Spread Syntax**:
   ```javascript
   const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
   const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5, 6];
   ```

6. **Rest Parameters**:
   ```javascript
   const sum = (...args) => args.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
   ```

7. **Default Parameters**:
   ```javascript
   const greet = (name = "World") => `Hello, ${name}!`;
   ```

8. **Classes**:
   ```javascript
   class Person {
       constructor(name) {
           this.name = name;
       }
       greet() {
           return `Hello, ${this.name}!`;
       }
   }
   ```

9. **Modules**:
   ```javascript
   // math.js
   export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   // app.js
   import { add } from './math.js';
   ```

10. **Promises**:
    ```javascript
    const fetchData = () => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            // Simulating async operation
            setTimeout(() => {
                resolve("Data fetched successfully");
            }, 2000);
        });
    };
    fetchData().then(data => console.log(data));
    ```

11. **Symbol**:
    ```javascript
    const uniqueKey = Symbol("unique");
    ```

12. **Iterators and Generators**:
    ```javascript
    const iterableObj = {
        [Symbol.iterator]: function* () {
            yield 1;
            yield 2;
            yield 3;
        }
    };
    for (let value of iterableObj) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

These examples demonstrate how ES6 features can be used to write more concise and expressive JavaScript code.

## Array Methods
Arrays are used in JavaScript to store multiple values in a single variable. They are a type of object and can hold any type of data, including other arrays or objects. Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.

Here are some common array methods in JavaScript:

1. **push**: Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
   fruits.push("orange");
   // fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
   ```

2. **pop**: Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   let lastFruit = fruits.pop();
   // fruits is now ["apple", "banana"]
   // lastFruit is "orange"
   ```

3. **shift**: Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   let firstFruit = fruits.shift();
   // fruits is now ["banana", "orange"]
   // firstFruit is "apple"
   ```

4. **unshift**: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["banana", "orange"];
   fruits.unshift("apple");
   // fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
   ```

5. **slice**: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "kiwi"];
   let citrus = fruits.slice(2);
   // citrus is ["orange", "kiwi"]
   ```

6. **splice**: Changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   fruits.splice(1, 1, "kiwi", "melon");
   // fruits is now ["apple", "kiwi", "melon", "orange"]
   ```

7. **forEach**: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
   ```javascript
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   fruits.forEach(fruit => {
       console.log(fruit);
   });
   // Output:
   // apple
   // banana
   // orange
   ```

8. **map**: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3];
   let doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
   // doubled is [2, 4, 6]
   ```

9. **filter**: Creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let evens = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
   // evens is [2, 4]
   ```

10. **reduce**: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
    ```javascript
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    // sum is 15
    ```

These are just a few examples of array methods in JavaScript. Arrays offer a powerful way to store and manipulate collections of data.
