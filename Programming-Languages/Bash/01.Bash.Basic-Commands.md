## Navigating the File System

To navigate the file system in bash, you can use the following commands:
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
  - `ls -l`: List files in long format, showing permissions and other details.
  - `ls -a`: List all files, including hidden files (those starting with `.`).
- `cd`: Change directory.
  - `cd ..`: Move up one directory.
  - `cd ~`: Move to the home directory.
  - `cd /path/to/directory`: Move to a specific directory.

Example:
```bash
pwd
ls -l
cd ..
```

## Working with Files and Directories

Basic commands for working with files and directories:
- `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
- `touch`: Create a new file.
- `cp`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `rm`: Remove files or directories.
  - `rm -r directory`: Remove a directory and its contents recursively.
  - `rm -f file`: Forcefully remove a file without prompting.

Example:
```bash
mkdir mydir
touch myfile.txt
cp myfile.txt mydir/
mv myfile.txt mynewfile.txt
rm mynewfile.txt
```

## Viewing and Editing Files

Commands for viewing and editing files:
- `cat`: Display the contents of a file.
- `more`/`less`: Display file contents page by page.
- `head`/`tail`: Display the beginning/end of a file.
- `nano`/`vim`/`emacs`: Text editors for editing files.

Example:
```bash
cat myfile.txt
nano myfile.txt
```

## File Permissions

Commands for managing file permissions:
- `chmod`: Change file permissions.
- `chown`: Change file ownership.

Example:
```bash
chmod 755 myfile.sh
chown user:group myfile.txt
```

## Managing Processes

Commands for managing processes:
- `ps`: Display information about running processes.
- `kill`: Terminate a process.
- `bg`/`fg`: Move a process to the background/foreground.
- `jobs`: List background jobs.

Example:
```bash
ps
kill PID
```

## Chmod Command

### Modes:

- **Numeric Mode**:
  - Represents permissions as three octal digits (0-7) for user, group, and others.
  - Each digit corresponds to the sum of the permissions for read (4), write (2), and execute (1).
  - For example, `chmod 755 file` gives the owner full permissions, and group/other read and execute permissions.
- **Symbolic Mode**:
  - Uses symbols (`+`, `-`, `=`) to add, remove, or set permissions.
  - `u` for user, `g` for group, `o` for others, `a` for all.
  - Permissions: `r` for read, `w` for write, `x` for execute.

### Changing Permissions:

- **Numeric Mode**:
  - To add permissions: `chmod +x file`
  - To remove permissions: `chmod -w file`
  - To set permissions: `chmod 644 file` (user: read/write, group/other: read)
- **Symbolic Mode**:
  - To add permissions: `chmod u+x file`
  - To remove permissions: `chmod go-w file`
  - To set permissions: `chmod a=rw file` (all: read/write)

Example:
```bash
# Numeric mode
chmod 755 myfile.sh
# Symbolic mode
chmod u+x myfile.sh
```

### Special Permissions:

- **Set User ID (SUID)**: `chmod u+s file`
- **Set Group ID (SGID)**: `chmod g+s file`
- **Sticky Bit**: `chmod +t directory`

Special permissions change the behavior of file/directory execution and deletion.
