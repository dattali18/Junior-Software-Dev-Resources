# Bash Scripting: If-Else Block

## Introduction

In Bash scripting, conditional statements allow you to make decisions in your script based on different conditions. The `if-else` block is one of the most fundamental constructs for controlling the flow of a script. It allows you to execute a section of code if a certain condition is true, and another section of code if the condition is false.

## Structure of If-Else Block

### Basic If-Else Block

The basic syntax of an `if-else` block in Bash is:

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
  # code to execute if condition is true
else
  # code to execute if condition is false
fi
```

### If-Else-If Ladder

If you have multiple conditions to check, you can use the `if-else-if` ladder:

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
  # code to execute if condition1 is true
elif [ condition2 ]; then
  # code to execute if condition2 is true
else
  # code to execute if none of the above conditions are true
fi
```

### Nested If-Else Block

You can also nest `if-else` blocks to create more complex conditions:

```bash
if [ condition1 ]; then
  if [ condition2 ]; then
    # code to execute if both condition1 and condition2 are true
  else
    # code to execute if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
  fi
else
  # code to execute if condition1 is false
fi
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic If-Else

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter your age: " age

if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
  echo "You are an adult."
else
  echo "You are a minor."
fi
```

### Example 2: If-Else-If Ladder

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter a number: " num

if [ $num -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "The number is positive."
elif [ $num -lt 0 ]; then
  echo "The number is negative."
else
  echo "The number is zero."
fi
```

### Example 3: Nested If-Else

```bash
#!/bin/bash

read -p "Enter username: " username
read -sp "Enter password: " password
echo

if [ "$username" == "admin" ]; then
  if [ "$password" == "secret" ]; then
    echo "Access granted."
  else
    echo "Incorrect password."
  fi
else
  echo "Invalid username."
fi
```

## Comparison Operators

### Numeric Comparison

- `-eq`: equal to
- `-ne`: not equal to
- `-lt`: less than
- `-le`: less than or equal to
- `-gt`: greater than
- `-ge`: greater than or equal to

### String Comparison

- `=`: equal to
- `!=`: not equal to
- `<`: less than (in ASCII alphabetical order)
- `>`: greater than (in ASCII alphabetical order)

### File Comparison

- `-e`: file exists
- `-f`: file is a regular file
- `-d`: file is a directory
- `-r`: file is readable
- `-w`: file is writable
- `-x`: file is executable

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Use Double Brackets for Conditions**: Double brackets `[[ ... ]]` provide more features and are safer for string comparisons.
   
   ```bash
   if [[ $string1 == $string2 ]]; then
     echo "Strings are equal."
   fi
   ```

2. **Quote Variables**: Always quote variables to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.
   
   ```bash
   if [ "$var" == "value" ]; then
     echo "Variables match."
   fi
   ```

3. **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation to improve readability.
   
   ```bash
   if [ condition ]; then
     # indented code
   else
     # indented code
   fi
   ```

4. **Avoid Using Spaces Around Assignment Operators**: Spaces can cause syntax errors.
   
   ```bash
   var="value"  # Correct
   var = "value"  # Incorrect
   ```

## Conclusion

The `if-else` block is an essential part of Bash scripting, allowing you to execute different code paths based on conditions. Understanding its structure, comparison operators, and best practices will help you write more effective and reliable scripts. Happy scripting!
