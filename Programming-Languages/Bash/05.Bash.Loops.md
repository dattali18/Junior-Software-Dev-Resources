# Bash Scripting: Loops

## Introduction

Loops are essential in Bash scripting for executing a block of code multiple times. They are particularly useful for iterating over lists, arrays, or ranges. Bash supports several types of loops, including `for`, `while`, and `until`.

## Types of Loops

### For Loop

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a list of items. The basic syntax is:

```bash
for item in list; do
  # code to execute
done
```

### While Loop

A `while` loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true. The basic syntax is:

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
  # code to execute
done
```

### Until Loop

An `until` loop is similar to a `while` loop but continues to execute as long as a specified condition is false. The basic syntax is:

```bash
until [ condition ]; do
  # code to execute
done
```

## Iterating Over Lists

### Example 1: For Loop with a List

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List of items
items=("apple" "banana" "cherry")

# Iterate over the list
for item in "${items[@]}"; do
  echo "Item: $item"
done
```

### Example 2: For Loop with a Range

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Iterate over a range
for i in {1..5}; do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### Example 3: While Loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize a counter
counter=1

# Loop while the condition is true
while [ $counter -le 5 ]; do
  echo "Counter: $counter"
  ((counter++))
done
```

### Example 4: Until Loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Initialize a counter
counter=1

# Loop until the condition is true
until [ $counter -gt 5 ]; do
  echo "Counter: $counter"
  ((counter++))
done
```

## Using Arrays in Loops

### Example 5: Iterating Over an Array

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define an array
colors=("red" "green" "blue")

# Iterate over the array
for color in "${colors[@]}"; do
  echo "Color: $color"
done
```

## Loop Control

### Break Statement

The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    break
  fi
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

### Continue Statement

The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
  if [ $i -eq 5 ]; then
    continue
  fi
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

## Nested Loops

You can nest loops to handle more complex scenarios.

### Example 6: Nested For Loop

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Outer loop
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "Outer loop iteration: $i"

  # Inner loop
  for j in {1..2}; do
    echo "  Inner loop iteration: $j"
  done
done
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 7: Processing a List of Files

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# List of files
files=("file1.txt" "file2.txt" "file3.txt")

# Iterate over the list of files
for file in "${files[@]}"; do
  if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "$file exists."
  else
    echo "$file does not exist."
  fi
done
```

### Example 8: Reading Lines from a File

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# File to read
filename="input.txt"

# Check if file exists
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
  # Read each line from the file
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "Line: $line"
  done < "$filename"
else
  echo "File $filename does not exist."
fi
```

## Conclusion

Loops are a powerful feature in Bash scripting that allow you to repeat tasks efficiently. Whether you're iterating over a list, range, or array, understanding how to use `for`, `while`, and `until` loops will help you write more effective scripts. Additionally, knowing how to control loop flow with `break` and `continue` statements, as well as nesting loops, provides further flexibility in your scripts. Happy scripting!
