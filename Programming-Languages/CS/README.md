# C#

C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative. Designed to be simple, powerful, and flexible, C# is widely used for building Windows applications, web services, and enterprise software. Its syntax is similar to other C-based languages like C++ and Java, making it relatively easy to learn for developers familiar with those languages.
