# Git Branches and Branching

In Git, branches are used to work on different versions of a repository simultaneously. They allow you to isolate work on a new feature or bug fix without affecting the main codebase. Here's an overview of Git branches and branching:

## Creating a Branch
To create a new branch, use the `git branch` command followed by the branch name:

```bash
git branch <branch_name>
```

For example, to create a new branch called `feature-x`:

```bash
git branch feature-x
```

## Switching Branches
To switch to a different branch, use the `git checkout` command followed by the branch name:

```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```

For example, to switch to the `feature-x` branch:

```bash
git checkout feature-x
```

Alternatively, you can combine branch creation and switching with a single command:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch_name>
```

## Viewing Branches
You can view all branches in your repository using the `git branch` command:

```bash
git branch
```

The branch you are currently on will be highlighted with an asterisk (`*`).

## Merging Branches
To merge changes from one branch into another (e.g., merging a feature branch into the main branch), use the `git merge` command:

1. Switch to the branch you want to merge changes into (e.g., `main`):

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Merge the changes from the other branch (e.g., `feature-x`):

   ```bash
   git merge feature-x
   ```

## Deleting Branches
To delete a branch once you no longer need it, use the `git branch -d` command:

```bash
git branch -d <branch_name>
```

For example, to delete the `feature-x` branch:

```bash
git branch -d feature-x
```

## Summary
- Use `git branch` to create, list, and delete branches.
- Use `git checkout` to switch between branches.
- Use `git merge` to merge changes from one branch into another.

Branches are a powerful feature of Git that allow for parallel development and easy collaboration on projects. They help keep your codebase organized and make it easier to work on different features or fixes simultaneously.
